# ToDoList---JS-HTML-CSS

Create a To Do List using HTML, CSS and Java Script.

You can add a new item dynamically at a To Do List and when you complete a specific task you can mark it as completed. If you marked it complete by mistake you can uncheck it and will show again in the first group of tasks that are not complete yet
